                <p id="myBio"> Hey! My name is Sasank Ganapathiraju, a fellow bootcamp student! Before I started taking classes at the UofT coding bootcamp I was a actually a UofT student! While working and volunteering in various labs across the university I manifested an interest in web-design, which is why I joined this bootcamp to learn how to be a web-developer! <br>I began my undergraduate degree in 2013 majoring in molecular biology/immunology/toxicology as well as psychology. While I never officially completed the major, I took almost all of the recquired courses offered by the departnment of biochemistry! 4 years of long lectures and exhausting lab work has turned me into a biology nerd. After my graduation last June, I have decided it was time to take on a new field and become a computer nerd!</p>
